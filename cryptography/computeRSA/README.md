### Problem
> RSA encryption/decryption is based on a formula that anyone can find and use, as long as they know the values to plug in. Given the encrypted number 150815, d = 1941, and N = 435979, what is the decrypted number?


### Answer
Reading HINTS, an expression of RSA decoding is written `decrypted = (encrypted) ^ d mod N`. So we assigned the given value to [this site](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~introcs/Fa11/notes/10.1_Cryptography/RSA_Express_EncryptDecrypt.html).
